# Mall Customer Segmentation

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
**Introduction**
To make predictions and find the clusters of potential customers of the mall and thus find
appropriate measures to increase the revenue of the mall is one of the prevailing applications
of unsupervised learning.
For example, a group of customers have high income but their spending score (amount spent in
the mall) is low so from the analysis we can convert such type of customers into potential
customers (whose spending score is high) by using strategies like better advertising, accepting
feedback and improving the quality of products.
To identify such customers, this project analyses and forms clusters based on different criteria
which are discussed in the further sections.



II. Dataset
The dataset name is ‘Mall_Customers.csv’ consists of 5 columns which are CustomerID,
Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100) where Gender is a categorical value
and rest all features are numeric.
